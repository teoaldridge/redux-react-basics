- Using Redux Data in React Components
- Dispatching Actions from inside Components
- Attaaching payloads to actions
- Working wit Multiple State Properties
- How to work with Redux State correctly
- Redux Toolkit
- Adding State Slices
- Connecting Redux Toolkit State
- Working with Multiple Slices
- Reading and Dispatching from a New Slice

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
